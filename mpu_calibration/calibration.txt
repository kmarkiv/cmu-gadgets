FINISHED!

Sensor readings with offsets:	-9	-4	16384	0	-2	0
Your offsets:	19	517	1211	220	19	13

Data is printed as: acelX acelY acelZ giroX giroY giroZ
Check that your sensor readings are close to 0 0 16384 0 0 0
If calibration was succesful write down your offsets so you can set them in your projects using something similar to mpu.setXAccelOffset(youroffset)
